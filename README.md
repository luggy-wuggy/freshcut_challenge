# freshcut_challenge

As part of FreshCut's interview process, I [Luqman Abdurrohman] must complete there take home Flutter coding challenge.

I need to implement the UI design from this Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/H5Q656sKyzmiFdfuDHNHwu/Trending-Today?node-id=1%3A3389

## Packages used
- [`riverpod` and `flutter_riverpod`](https://riverpod.dev/) : Used for the sake of state management, simply used to handle state for the bottom navigation bar
- [`percent_indicator`](https://pub.dev/packages/percent_indicator): Used for the linear progress bar in the cards to achieve the desired UI in the figma designs specifically the rounded ends and the gradient progress color
- [`gradient_borders`](https://pub.dev/packages/gradient_borders): Used for the gradient borders on the `HotCards` to achieve the desired UI in the figma designs

## Tools used 
- [Flutter Shape Maker](https://fluttershapemaker.com/): In order to display the custom icons for the bottom navigation icons, I used this website that converts SVG into Flutter Custom Paint Code. In doing so, I was able to change the color of the icons depending if it is selected or not.
